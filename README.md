# THPS Autosplitters
Livesplit Autosplitter runtime autosplitter for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series.

Why develop one autosplitter for the whole series?  It allows the autosplitter to work between games, if you would like to do a run of the whole series.

Huge shoutouts to Fog for writing the original autosplitter scripts most of this project is based on!
